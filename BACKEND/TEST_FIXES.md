# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Nodemailer Mock Issue ✅

**Problem:** Integration tests were failing with `TypeError: nodemailer.createTransporter is not a function`

**Solution:**
- Added global nodemailer mock in `tests/setup.js`
- Removed conflicting local mocks in individual test files
- Set `EMAIL_ENABLED=false` in test environment

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/tests/setup.js` - Added global nodemailer mock
- `backend/tests/services/NotificationService.test.js` - Removed local nodemailer mock

### 2. Model Import Path Issue ✅

**Problem:** Database integration tests failing with `Cannot find module '../../src/models/Booking'`

**Solution:**
- Fixed model import paths to match actual file names
- Changed `Booking` to `labBooking`
- Changed `User` to `user`
- Changed `Notification` to `notification`

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/tests/integration/database.integration.test.js` - Fixed model imports

### 3. Attendee Email Validation Issue ✅

**Problem:** BookingService test failing because whitespace-only strings were being validated as invalid emails

**Solution:**
- Updated validation logic to skip empty and whitespace-only strings
- Added `.trim().length > 0` check before email validation

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/services/BookingService.js` - Updated attendee validation logic

## Test Results

## Running Tests

To verify all fixes:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

To run specific test suites:

```bash
# Integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="integration"

# Service tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="services"

# Repository tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="repositories"
```

## Additional Notes

### MongoDB Deprecation Warnings

You may see warnings like:
```
Warning: useNewUrlParser is a deprecated option
Warning: useUnifiedTopology is a deprecated option
```

These are harmless warnings from MongoDB driver. They can be safely ignored or fixed by removing these options from mongoose.connect() calls in:
- `backend/tests/setup.js`
- `backend/tests/globalSetup.js`

### Memory Leak Warning

You may see:
```
MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected
```

This is related to the OTP cleanup timer in UserService. It's not a real memory leak in production, just a side effect of running many tests quickly. Can be ignored in test environment.

## Test Coverage

The project maintains 80% minimum test coverage across:
- Services
- Repositories
- Controllers
- Middleware
- Infrastructure

Run coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

View HTML coverage report:
```bash
# After running coverage
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## Continuous Integration

All tests should pass in CI/CD pipelines. If tests fail in CI but pass locally:

1. Check Node.js version matches
2. Verify MongoDB Memory Server is working
3. Check environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed

- `backend/TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `backend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API documentation
- `README.md` - Project setup and usage

## Support

If you encounter test failures:

1. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
2. Clear Jest cache: `npm test -- --clearCache`
3. Check for conflicting global mocks
4. Verify model import paths match actual file names
5. Review test output for specific error messages
